# Pax 

pax is a current passion project to learn to write Zig (better because im a total dimwit) and to 
try and simlify the process of adding and linking dependencies/packages to a project.

Personally, I find it "confusing" but I also want to create this tool to just have some fun and 
hopefully provide some kind of value to the community.
